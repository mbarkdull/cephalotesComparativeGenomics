## Introduction
The goal of this project is to sequence five new genomes from the ant genus *Cephalotes*, assemble them to the reference *C. varians* genome, and then use these data to better understand the genetic basis of caste polymorphism. 

## Citing
This workflow implements many different tools, all of which should be cited. I have noted appropriate citations throughout the text of this ReadMe. Please properly credit these researchers' hard work!

In addition, if this workflow has been useful to you, please cite the Github repository:

## Reference-guided genome assembly
Reference-guided genome assembly has the following steps:

  1. Trim raw reads with Trimmomatic.
  2. Map the trimmed reads back to the reference genome (I'll probably use NextGenMap for this).
  3. Call SNPs and indels with SAMtools. 
  4. Filter the calls by quality. 
  5. Assemble a consensus sequence. 
  
These steps are all implemented by the scripts `./Scripts/referenceGuidedAssembly`, which requires two arguments: first, a list of samples, and two, the number of threads to use for multithreaded steps. 

Note that this script currently has a lot of hard-coded paths, including the paths to each program. The location and names of your raw sequencing files will also be different than those in this script, so update accordingly. 

If you use this script, please cite:
