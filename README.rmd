## Introduction
The goal of this project is to sequence five new genomes from the ant genus *Cephalotes*, assemble them to the reference *C. varians* genome, and then use these data to better understand the genetic basis of caste polymorphism. 

## Reference-guided genome assembly
Reference-guided genome assembly has the following steps:

  1. Trim raw reads with Trimmomatic.
  2. Map the trimmed reads back to the reference genome (I'll probably use NextGenMap for this).
  3. Call SNPs and indels with SAMtools. 
  4. Filter the calls by quality. 
  5. Assemble a consensus sequence.
